        ðŸš€ ADVANCED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM ðŸš€
        
        This implementation features state-of-the-art user and team suggestion algorithms that go far beyond 
        simple random selection. The system uses machine learning-inspired techniques including:
        
        ðŸ§  TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS:
        â€¢ Network Similarity Analysis (30%): Finds teams followed by users you also follow
        â€¢ Badge Compatibility Matching (25%): Teams with shared interests/achievements  
        â€¢ Popularity & Activity Scoring (20%): Active teams with engaged communities
        â€¢ Mutual Connection Discovery (15%): Teams with members you know
        â€¢ Freshness Factor (10%): Promotes newer teams for diversity
        
        ðŸ§  USER RECOMMENDATIONS:  
        â€¢ Collaborative Filtering (35%): "Users like you also follow..." algorithm
        â€¢ Badge Affinity Matching (25%): Users with complementary skills/interests
        â€¢ Team Connection Analysis (20%): Teammates of your teammates
        â€¢ Social Proof Weighting (15%): Popular users with proven engagement
        â€¢ Activity Recency Bonus (5%): Recently active users get priority
        
        ðŸŽ¯ SMART FILTERING:
        â€¢ Excludes completely inactive users (1+ year)
        â€¢ Prioritizes users with badges, followers, or recent activity
        â€¢ Ensures diverse results through controlled randomization
        â€¢ Includes relevance scores for transparency and tuning
        
        This system scales intelligently and improves recommendations as the network grows!
