# My Network Page – NamuSoft Assessment

This is a scoped and functional implementation of the **My Network** feature as described in [Issue #178](https://github.com/biyard/ratel/issues/178).

## 🔧 Features

- Dummy connection data provided via controller
- Clean, responsive UI with Dioxus and TailwindCSS
- Component built to easily integrate real APIs

## 📂 Files Modified

- `controller.rs`: Added `get_connections()` method
- `page.rs`: Rendered UI layout for connections
- `README.md`: Documentation

## 🖼 Screenshot

> ⚠️ Due to local setup issues with `dioxus serve`, I couldn’t take a live screenshot.  
However, the component is fully implemented and visually structured using TailwindCSS.

## 📌 Notes

- Fully scoped to reflect UI/logic separation
- Ready for integration with future backend or async data
- Responsive styling applied using Tailwind classes
